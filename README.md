# GetReposByLanguage
This application allows you to find recent repos from "api.github.com", after choosing a language. We get data by using the Get method from the Rest API. 
I used the [json-simple-1.1.jar] library link(http://www.java2s.com/Code/Jar/j/Downloadjsonsimple11jar.htm), which helps to manipulate JSON data. 
Hope you enjoy it!
